I have a few servers that I run that I don't want to have to think about. I want them to be secure, up-to-date, and running smoothly without me having to do anything.

I have a repo where I keep my script for this: https://github.com/crypdick/unattended-server-quickstart. To use it, you can use the following one-liner:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crypdick/unattended-server-quickstart/main/unattended_server_quickstart.sh | sudo bash
```
